# hindsight-agent

A post-implementation code review agent for Claude Code. Once Claude finishes a commit, hindsight reviews it with fresh eyes and asks: *now that we have a working solution, is there a cleaner approach?*

Distributed two ways:
- **Claude Code plugin** — auto-fires after every `git commit`, `git commit --amend`, or `git rebase` Claude runs in a session
- **CLI** — `hindsight-agent` you can invoke manually against any commit range

Both surfaces share the same review engine, cache, and log.

## Why?

When Claude Code is mid-task, it makes local decisions to keep the work moving. Abstractions get introduced, helpers get extracted, patterns emerge that made sense in flight. Once the task is done and the solution actually works, those choices often look different. A fresh second pass — done by an agent that never saw the journey, only the destination — catches things the original pass can't.

That's hindsight: a separate agent, with its own system prompt and its own tools, that reviews the *finished* state and tells you whether there's a cleaner version.

## How it works

```
Claude runs `git commit` (or --amend, or rebase)
    │
    ▼
PostToolUse hook fires (async — Claude session never blocks)
    │
    ▼
Resolve range:  commit/amend → HEAD~1..HEAD
                rebase       → ORIG_HEAD..HEAD
    │
    ▼
Skip rules (main branch, WIP, [no-review], cap=3)
    │
    ▼
Hash the diff (doc files excluded)
    │
┌───┴───┐
▼       ▼
cached?  miss?
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   Phase 1: Triage (Haiku)
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   Phase 2: Deep review (Sonnet)
    │   with prior review on this branch as context
    │       │
    └───────┴──► Append to reviews.log
                 │
                 ▼
            Stop hook surfaces `worth_refactoring`
            verdicts back into the Claude session
```

Every run produces a log entry, even skips. The log is the single source of truth for what the agent has done.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+**
- **An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)** in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Git**
- **Claude Code 2.x** (for plugin install)
- **`jq`** (used by the plugin's hook script — almost certainly already on your system)

## Install (plugin — recommended)

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add danworkman1/hindsight-agent
/plugin install hindsight-agent@danielworkman
```

That's it. Restart Claude Code if prompted. From the next session forward, every commit Claude makes triggers an async review, and any `worth_refactoring` verdicts are surfaced back into the session via the Stop hook.

Make sure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is exported in your shell environment — the plugin reads it from the inherited env when the hook fires.

### Tail the log (optional)

Reviews stream to `reviews.log` in whatever git repo Claude was working in. Tail it in a side terminal if you want to read every entry:

```bash
tail -f reviews.log
```

You'll also want to add `reviews.log` and `review-cache.json` to your `.gitignore`.

## Install (CLI — manual trigger)

For one-off reviews outside a Claude Code session:

```bash
npm install -g hindsight-agent
# or use it ephemerally: npx hindsight-agent ...
```

Then in any git repo:

```bash
hindsight-agent                    # review HEAD~1..HEAD
hindsight-agent --base main        # review the whole branch vs main
hindsight-agent --force            # bypass cache + skip rules
```

The CLI is the same engine the plugin uses. Useful for reviewing your own commits, replaying after a cache wipe, or testing prompt changes.

## CLI reference

```
hindsight-agent [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--path <dir>` | Run against this repo instead of cwd |
| `--base <ref>` | Diff against `<ref>..HEAD` instead of `HEAD~1..HEAD` |
| `--force` | Skip cache, skip-rules, and the no-changes guard |
| `--triage-model <model>` | Phase 1 model. Default: `haiku` |
| `--review-model <model>` | Phase 2 model. Default: `sonnet` |
| `help` | Print usage |

**Model values:** `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` (or a raw Anthropic model ID).

### Examples

```bash
# Review the last commit (same as the plugin would after Claude commits)
hindsight-agent

# Force a review of everything on this branch vs main
hindsight-agent --force --base main

# Point at a different repo
hindsight-agent --path ~/coding/my-project --force --base main

# Use Opus for the deep review pass
hindsight-agent --force --base main --review-model opus
```

## Reading the log

```
[2026-05-03T10:25:42Z] [my-project] [REVIEW] Added auth middleware in src/auth.ts

**Verdict: clean**
The implementation is straightforward and well-scoped...

[2026-05-03T10:31:08Z] [my-project] [REVIEW] Refactored user fetching into a hook

**Verdict: worth refactoring**
The new `useUserData` hook duplicates logic that already lives in
`useAuth`. Consider consolidating...
```

- `[skip]` lines — agent ran, nothing to review (no code changes, doc-only commit, etc.)
- `[REVIEW] ... clean` — code looks good, no action needed
- `[REVIEW] ... worth refactoring` — read this one; the agent thinks there's a cleaner approach

When the plugin is installed, `worth_refactoring` reviews are also surfaced directly back into the active Claude Code session via the Stop hook — you don't have to be tailing the log to see them.

### Useful log commands

```bash
grep -A30 "\[REVIEW\]" reviews.log        # substantive reviews only
grep "\[my-project\]" reviews.log         # one project
grep "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)" reviews.log   # today
```

## Resetting

```bash
rm review-cache.json    # forces re-review of every diff
> reviews.log           # clear the log
```

## Behaviour notes

- **Async** — the plugin hook returns immediately; reviews never block your Claude session
- **Exits 0 on errors** — a failed review never blocks Claude or your commits
- **Cache** grows unbounded under normal use; soft cap at 5MB triggers eviction down to the 1000 most recent entries
- **Untracked files** are included in the hash and the review (uncommitted new files would otherwise be invisible to `git diff`)
- **Branch cap**: 3 reviews per branch. After that, runs log a `[CAP]` line and skip the model call. Use `--force` to override
- **Skipped commit messages**: `wip`, `WIP`, `[no-review]`
- **Skipped branches**: `main`, `master` (squash-merges and CI commits don't burn reviews)
- **Prior review context**: when re-reviewing a branch, the prior verdict and suggestions are fed into the prompt so the model reassesses rather than repeating itself
- **Rebases** review the entire `ORIG_HEAD..HEAD` range as one pass, not per-commit
- **Amends** review `HEAD~1..HEAD`; if the diff hash is unchanged from the original commit, the cached verdict is replayed (no API call)

## Costs

Rough per-run costs at current Anthropic pricing:

- Skip path / cache hit: **$0**
- Triage only, no code changes: **fractions of a cent** (Haiku)
- Triage + deep review: **a few cents** depending on diff size

The diff-hash cache means you only pay for unique working-tree states. Set a monthly spending cap in the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits) while you're getting comfortable.

## Feedback mode (Stop hook internals)

`surface.js` is the plugin's Stop-hook entry point. When the review pipeline lands a `worth_refactoring` verdict for the current HEAD, surface writes it to stderr and exits 2 — Claude Code's protocol for injecting a prompt back into the conversation. Each review is surfaced at most once (tracked via the `surfaced` flag in the cache). The hook respects `stop_hook_active` so it can't recurse on its own output.

If you installed via `npm` (CLI only, no plugin), you can wire the Stop hook up by hand in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "/absolute/path/to/hindsight-agent/surface.js" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Particularly interested in:

- Better triage prompts (the model occasionally over- or under-reports)
- Additional tools the deep review could benefit from (e.g. running tests, viewing recent commit history)
- A "defer to worktree" surface mode for `worth_refactoring` verdicts
